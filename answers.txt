Exercise 6: Role of the Loader

Shared Libraries Dynamically Loaded:

1- linux-vdso.so.1: Virtual Dynamic Shared Object provided by the kernel to speed up some system calls.
2- libc.so.6: Standard C library containing basic functions like printf, scanf, malloc, etc.
3- /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: Dynamic loader / linker responsible for loading shared libraries at runtime.
