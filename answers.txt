Exercise 1: 

- creates a new process (child)
- This demonstrates how process creation works in Linux

-------------------------------------------
Exercise 2:

- sleep 300 &: runs a process in the background.
- job: Shows all background processes created by the current shell.
-------------------------------------------
Exercise 3:

- ps aux | grep sleep ---> Use ps to find the process ID (PID) of the sleep process you started.
- kill <PID> ---> Stop the process using kill.
- ps aux | grep sleep ---> Verify the process is no longer running:

-------------------------------------------
Exercise 4: 

- kill -STOP <PID> ----> Pause a process
- kill -CONT <PID> ----> Resume the process
-------------------------------------------
Exercise 5:

- Demonstrates multi-file compilation and linking.
-------------------------------------------
Exercise 6: Role of the Loader

Shared Libraries Dynamically Loaded:
1- linux-vdso.so.1: Virtual Dynamic Shared Object provided by the kernel to speed up some system calls.
2- libc.so.6: Standard C library containing basic functions like printf, scanf, malloc, etc.
3- /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: Dynamic loader / linker responsible for loading shared libraries at runtime.

-------------------------------------------
1- what is the job of the Linker?

- Combines object files and libraries into a single executable, resolving all references and Prepares the program so it is ready to run.

-------------------------------------------
2- what is the job of the Loader?

- Loads the executable into memory, links dynamic libraries, and sets up runtime environment.
